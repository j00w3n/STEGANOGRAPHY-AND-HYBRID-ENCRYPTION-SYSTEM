# STEGANOGRAPHY-AND-HYBRID-ENCRYPTION-SYSTEM-BETA-

This is my Final Year Project (FYP) which my scope more focuses on security software development

ABOUT THE SYSTEM
The combination of 2 security approaches enchance the level of security of the system
Stegeanography alone or Cryptography alone less secure

Steganography is a process of embedding data into steganographic media such as image , audio and video

My Project focuses on Image Steganography

Hybrid Encryion AES-RSA provides another layer of security
- AES responsible to encrypt and decrypt the data using AES PUBLIC KEY (SYMMETRIC KEY)
- RSA responsible to encrypt and decrypt the AES PUBLIC KEY so the key cannot be detectable or readable during communication

The implementation of project using Socket Programming and use server-client model to create TCP/IP connection.
